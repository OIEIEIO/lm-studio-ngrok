### Share Your AI Frontend with a Friend Using LMStudio, Gradio, and Ngrok

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a frontend for your AI model using **LMStudio** and **Gradio**, and share it with a friend over the internet using **Ngrok**.

## Step 1: Start LMStudio

1. Launch **LMStudio** on your PC as you normally would.
2. Start the **LMStudio server** on port `1234`.

## Step 2: Build a Frontend with Gradio

1. Write or expand on a basic **Gradio** app to create a user-friendly frontend for interacting with your AI model.
2. Run your Gradio app. By default, Gradio will host the frontend locally at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.
3. Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:7860` to interact with your AI model.

**Example Gradio App written in Python:**
```
python3 gradio-8.py
```
At this point, your frontend is accessible locally.

##Step 3: Share the Frontend with a Friend Using Ngrok

Download Ngrok:

Visit ngrok.com and download the tool for your operating system.
Follow the installation instructions.
Start Ngrok: Open a terminal and run the following command:

```ngrok http 7860```

Ngrok will create a secure, public URL that tunnels traffic to your local Gradio app running on port 7860.

Share the Link: Ngrok will display a public URL (e.g., https://xyz.ngrok.io). Share this link with your friend, and they can access your Gradio frontend and interact with your hosted AI model directly from their browser.
